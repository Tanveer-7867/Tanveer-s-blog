HTML is used to structure your webpage content. Here's the breakdown:

1. <html> Tag

<html lang="en">
This is the root element of the HTML document. It defines that the language of the page is English (lang="en").

2. <head> Section

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta name="description" content="TANVEER – Cyberpunk-style deep dive into nature’s wonders." />
  <meta name="keywords" content="Tanveer, nature, cyberpunk, blog, exploration" />
  <meta name="author" content="Tanveer" />
  <title>TANVEER | Nature in Neon</title>
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
This section is for metadata and linking resources:

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Defines the character encoding for the page.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is responsive, adjusting its layout based on the device's screen size.

The <meta> tags for description, keywords, and author help with SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

The <title> sets the title of the webpage in the browser tab.

The <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /> is linking an external CSS file (styles.css) to style the page.
